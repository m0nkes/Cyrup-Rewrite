# About

Cyrup is an old Roblox Lua executor project I started a while ago. It is officially discontinued, however, I found the source code on one of my hard drives. The code was horrible, and I decided to completely rewrite the project. The rewrite does lack some features such as:

- Discord Rich Presence
- Update checker
- Multiple APIs

This currently uses the [WeAreDevs API](https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API).
