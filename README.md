# About

Cyrup is an old Roblox Lua executor project I started a while ago. I found the old source code on one of my hard drives. The code was horrible, and I decided to completely rewrite the project. The rewrite does lack some features such as:

- Discord Rich Presence
- Multiple APIs

The original post-rewrite source code can be found in the [original branch](https://github.com/deaddlocust/Cyrup-Rewrite/tree/original).

This currently uses the [WeAreDevs API](https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API).
